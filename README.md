# GridSPT.jl-tests

Tests for the GridSPT.jl package.

The notebook can be viewed on Google Colab [here](https://githubtocolab.com/MatPeron/GridSPT.jl-tests/blob/main/tests.ipynb). GridSPT.jl is the Julia version of the original, written in C++. Unlike the original, it is designed to be faster, expandable, more general and autodifferentiable. The notebook contains tests to verify the accuracy against the C++ version, benchmarks, and autodiff tests.

Please note that the code is still experimental, and the GridSPT.jl repositories are still private due to publishing reasons. Once the code's results have been published, the repositories will be public as well, however any enquiries at matteo.peron@unipr.it are welcome!
